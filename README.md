Microservice receiving and sending payments in BitShares blockchain. 
Work with [Booker].

## Install
### Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)
#### Install with Docker
##### Requirements
* [Docker]
* [Docker Compose]

Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install git docker.io docker-compose
```

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fincubator/bitshares_gateway
cd bitshares_gateway
```

Create gateway config file and fill it with your data. If not, gateway will start in testnet with
parameters from tests dir.
```bash
cp config/gateway.yml.example config/gateway.yml
```

Create test *.env* file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Run
#### Run on production (mainnet)
```bash
sudo docker-compose run -d postgres
sudo docker-compose run gateway
```
>Why not docker-compose up command?'
>> Because on production we need some interactive shell to input keys/password

#### Running in testnet
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```
Will be using test account from test fixtures

# How it works
##### Using bitshares_utils:


```python
# Simple example to issue some asset

import asyncio

from bitshares_utils import *

async def issue_loop_example():
    """Setup bitshares instance"""
    await init_bitshares(node="wss://your.node",
                        account="your_account_name",
                        keys=["5Ksk..YouMemoKey", "5Ksk..YouActiveKey"],)
    
    # Non broadcasted transaction
    pre_tx = await asset_issue("your.bitshares.name", 10, "FINTEH.USDT")
    
    """Doing your stuff"""    

    # Broadcast now!
    await broadcast_tx(pre_tx)


asyncio.run(issue_loop_example())
```
