Microservice receiving and sending payments in BitShares blockchain.
Work with [Booker].

## Install
### Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)
#### Install with Docker
##### Requirements
* [Docker]
* [Docker Compose]

Install dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install git docker.io docker-compose
```

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fincubator/bitshares_gateway
cd bitshares_gateway
```

Create gateway config file and fill it with your data. If not, gateway will start in testnet with testing
parameters.
```bash
cp gateway.yml.example gateway.yml
```

Create test *.env* file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Run
#### Run on production (mainnet)
```bash
sudo docker-compose run -d postgres
sudo docker-compose run gateway
```
>Why not 'docker-compose up' command?
>> Because on production we need some interactive shell to input keys/password

#### Running in testnet
```bash
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```
Will be using default test account

# How it works
BitShares Gateway serve SINGLE bitshares asset.
It means that if you want to run `Bitcoin/BITSHARES.BITCOIN_ASSET` exchange, you need to deploy 3 instances:
1. This project (configured to work with BITSHARES.BITCOIN_ASSET)
2. [Booker]
3. Some Bitcoin gateway that can interact with [Booker] API

Also it means that if you want to run 10 cryptocurrency exchanges, you need 10 instances of BitShares Gateway, 10 coin (Native)
gateways and one [Booker]

`Gateway` class in `src/gateway.py` file is a heart of project logic. It is still in development.

##### Using bitshares_utils:
There is `src/bitshares_utils.py` module - useful async python tools over [Pybitshares] allow to build gateway's algorithms
simple and fast.

```python
# Simple example to issue some asset

import asyncio

from src.blockchain.bitshares_utils import *

async def issue_loop_example():
    """Setup bitshares instance"""
    await init_bitshares(node="wss://your.node",
                        account="your_account_name",
                        keys=["5Ksk..YouMemoKey", "5Ksk..YouActiveKey"],)

    # Non broadcasted transaction
    pre_tx = await asset_issue("your.bitshares.name", 10, "FINTEH.USDT")

    """Doing your stuff"""

    # Broadcast now!
    await broadcast_tx(pre_tx)


asyncio.run(issue_loop_example())
```

#### Tests
BitShares Gateway has unit tests that can be run with [Pytest] framework. It's running actuomatically on every push in Github Actions.

To run it manually, execute inside `gateway` container:
```shell script
pipenv install --dev
pipenv run pytest
```

##### Where is gateway wallet account private keys?
Wallet account's keys stored as base64-encoded strings in file `.accountname.keys`.
This file will be created after first run with filled `gateway.yml` file.
